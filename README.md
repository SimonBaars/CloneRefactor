# CloneRefactor
We bridged a gap between clone detection and refactoring by designing a tool that can detect clones by our refactoring-oriented clone types. This tool performs a comprehensive context analysis on the detected clones. Based on this this context, CloneRefactor can automatically refactor a subset of the detected clones by applying transformations to the source code of the analyzed software project(s).

Please read my thesis for more details of this tool (I will add it to this repo shortly).
